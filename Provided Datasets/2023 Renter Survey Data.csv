In previous years a skip had been promised as a regular event but did not last. Ground level car park garage door is still not replaced after a number of weeks. Report of resident cages being broken into and car over the last month have apparently been an issue. If residents leave 2nd hand or new clothes for other  residents to have the management leave a notice to stop and throw all the items in the bin. This is very offensive to us all as this is our home and community. Management should concentrate on the bigger issues as discussed. It’s not the rental officers or maintenance staff it is the higher management who are making theses decisions. Appreciate having the opportunity to do the survey. Thanks.,Negative,Housing services

As a direct result of getting attacked - I needed to leave where I was living. It was too dangerous. I was no longer safe.  What my Housing Manager Eren did well was talk with another Housing Officer for me to move to another property. I went from a Studio Apartment which as going to be the last place I lived in to a Rooming House.  This caused immense problems. It was not a planned move.

There needs to be a policy about the privacy of children that reside in HF homes.  3)  Is there even a tenants association for every building?  Our building's shared area was 'decorated' and it is useless.  No one consulted anyone that uses the space.  Why can't every building have a notice board at the entrance and a voluntary tenants association? It would save HF money as well as increasing the wellbeing of tenants. An annual survey can not do what actual face to face tenants organisation can do. I know HF does the best they can. Just let the tenants help. We all want the same thing.

Housing First should make more effort to minimise the number of times they need to enter our homes within a year. Maintenance, e.g. changing door batteries, and different types of inspections could all be scheduled for one day without too much extra effort. It’s hugely disruptive to have people coming into my apartment every few weeks. I also want to run a business from home where I would have confidential conversations with clients online.
